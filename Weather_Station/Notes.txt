/* Observer Pattern
 - Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, 
   all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
*/

// Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
// Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects.


//currently subject is pushy as it sends the data to the observer without the observer asking for it.
// we can make it pull based by passing the observer object to the subject and let the observer ask for the data when it needs it.
