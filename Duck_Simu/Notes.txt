Design Principle 
- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
- Program to an interface, not an implementation.
- Favor composition over inheritance. (most time is spe nt on maintaing the code rather than writing it so use interface than inheritane)

Strategy pattern is used to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one of them and make them interchangeable. 
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
Algorithm eg (swimwithwings, swimnoway) are encapsulated in separate classes and they are interchangeable
